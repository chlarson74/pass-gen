PROJECT DESCRIPTION -- I was provided with the HTML document and existing CSS styles. I was tasked to create a Javasctript code that would generate a password for the user. The password has to be a characters length between 8 and 128 characters long. The user could choose from a list of available character setss (i.e. uppercase, lowercase, numbers etc.). The user would be presented with their new password once they have selected the parameters.

Work completed:
- Create a list of character arrays
- Create a prompting function with a series of if/else statements.
- Confirm that the user has chosen a character length of the required value
- Confirm that the user has chosen at least one character set
- Integrate the UCB premade code with the code I developed through instruction, research and study groups to make a functioning password generator.

## Usage 

Webpage deployed online is accessible through a web browser like Google Chrome.


## Learning Points 

- Create variables and apply them to javascript functions.
- Create an array for a variable
- Prompt the user with javascript
- Implement an if/else statement
- Concat arrays
- Alert the user if something isn't correct
- Math.floor will round down and Math.ceil will round up
- Research, reading, instruction and study groups are crucial to success
