PROJECT DESCRIPTION -- I was provided with the HTML document with existing CSS styles. I was tasked to create a Javasctript code that would generate a password for the user. The password has to be a characters length between 8 and 128 characters long. The user could choose from a list of available character setss (i.e. uppercase, lowercase, numbers etc.). The user would be presented with their new password once they have selected the parameters. 

Work completed:
- Create a list of character arrays
- Create a prompting function with a series of if/else statements.
- Confirm that the user has chosen a character lenght of the required value
- Confirm that the user has chosen at least one character set
- Integrate the UCB premade code with the code I developed through research, tutoring and study groups to make a functioning password generator.
